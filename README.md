# LightWM
### Minimalist Tiling Window Manager For MS-Windows

## Building

You can build using the "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022" that comes with Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools:

In the console you can run nmake to build according to the Makefile

```nmake```

I haven't tried building with a different VS version or building x86, but that may work as well.

## Todo

- Add keyboard navigation
- Add workspaces
